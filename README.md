### The assignment itself was straightforward and simple. I have done similar projects before so grabbing json data from an API link wasn't difficult. I'm already familar with how to use fetch and parsing data. I spent the most time on this project trying to get my table to look exactly like the example from the professor. I'm not sure if that's an exact requirment, however I decided to make it as true to the example as possible. I tried different border styles, margins, spacing, and ultimately I think I got it pretty close!
